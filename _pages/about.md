I'm a second year M.S.E. student studying Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm particularly focused in machine learning and algorthmic fairness, working with [Professor Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/).

Before graduate school I was a Midshipman at the United States Naval Academy where I recieved a B.S. in Mathematics and a commision into the United States Navy as a Naval Officer.
