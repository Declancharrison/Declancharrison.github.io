I am a research affiliate in the Kearns-Roth research group at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my M.S.E. in Computer and Information Science from the Unviersity of Pennsylvania where I was advised by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/). My researchs interests are aligned with machine learning "red-teaming", namely algorthmic fairness in ML, prompt engineering, and vulnerability testing in model deployments. 

Proir to Penn, I received a B.S in Mathematics from the United States Naval Academy and commissioned into the US Navy.
