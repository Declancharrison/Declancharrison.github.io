I'm a second year M.S.E. student studying Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm particularly interestesd in machine learning and algorthmic fairness, working with [Professor Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/) and [Professor Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/).

Before graduate school, I was a Midshipman at the United States Naval Academy where I recieved a B.S. in Mathematics. My wonderful advisor [Professor Kate Thompson](https://sites.google.com/site/katethompsonhomepage/?pli=1) advised an expository thesis in post-quantum cryptography.
